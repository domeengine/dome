graphics
=============

The `graphics` module provides utilities for drawing to the screen.

It contains the following classes:

* [Canvas](#canvas)
* [Color](#color)
* [Drawable](#drawable)
* [Font](#font)
* [ImageData](#imagedata)
* [SpriteSheet](#spritesheet)

## Canvas

The `Canvas` class is the core api for graphical display.

### Fields
#### `static font: String`
This is the name of the default font used for `Canvas.print(str, x, y, color)`. You can set this to `Font.default` to return to the DOME built-in font.
#### `static height: Number`
This is the height of the canvas/viewport, in pixels.
#### `static width: Number`
This is the width of the canvas/viewport, in pixels.
#### `static offset: Vector`
A vector representing the Canvas offset. You can both get and set this value.
#### `static clip: Vector`
A vector representing the Canvas clipping region. The `z` and `w` fields correspond to the width and height, respectively.

### Methods
#### `static circle(x: Number, y: Number, r: Number, c: Color) `
Draw a circle, centered at coordinates (_x_, _y_), with a radius _r_, in the color _c_.

#### `static circlefill(x: Number, y: Number, r: Number, c: Color) `
Draw a filled circle, centered at coordinates (_x_, _y_), with a radius _r_, in the color _c_.


#### `static clip()`
#### `static clip(x: Number, y: Number, w: Number, h: Number) `
This sets a "clipping region" for the canvas. No pixels will be drawn outside of the defined region. If this method is called without arguments it resets the clipping area to the whole display.

#### `static cls() `
This clears the canvas fully, to black. This ignores the `Canvas.clip` and `Canvas.offset` commands.

#### `static cls(c: Color) `
This clears the canvas fully, to the color _c_. This ignores the `Canvas.clip` and `Canvas.offset` commands.

#### `static draw(object: Drawable, x: Number, y: Number) `
This method is syntactic sugar, to draw objects with a "draw(x: Number, y: Number)" method.

#### `static ellipse(x0: Number, y0: Number, x1: Number, y1: Number, c: Color) `
Draw an ellipse between (_x0, y0_) and (_x1, y1_) in the color _c_.

#### `static ellipsefill(x0: Number, y0: Number, x1: Number, y1: Number, c: Color) `
Draw a filled ellipse between (_x0, y0_) and (_x1, y1_) in the color _c_.

#### `static getPrintArea(text: String): Vector`
Return a [Vector](./math#vector) representing the maximum height and width needed to draw `text` in the current default font.

#### `static line(x0: Number, y0: Number, x1: Number, y1: Number, c: Color) `
#### `static line(x0: Number, y0: Number, x1: Number, y1: Number, c: Color, size: Number) `
Draw a line `size` pixels wide between (_x0, y0_) and (_x1, y1_) in the color _c_. By default, `size` is 1.

#### `static offset()`
#### `static offset(x: Number, y: Number) `
Offset all following draw operations by (_x, y_). Calling this without arguments resets the offset to zero. You can use this to implement screen scrolling, or screenshake-style effects.

#### `static print(str, x: Number, y: Number, c: Color) `
Print the text _str_ with the top-left corner at (_x, y_) in color _c_, using the currently set default font. See `Canvas.font` for more information.
The text will be split across multiple lines if a newline (`\n`) character is encountered.
The vertical line spacing defaults to `fontHeight / 4`, where fontHeight is the maximum height of a font character in pixels, but this will be configurable in future versions of DOME.

#### `static print(str, x: Number, y: Number, c: Color, fontName: String) `
Print the text _str_ with the top-left corner at (_x, y_) in color _c_, in the specified font.
The text will be split across multiple lines if a newline (`\n`) character is encountered.
The vertical line spacing is calculated for each font, but this will be configurable in future versions of DOME.

#### `static pset(x: Number, y: Number, c: Color) `
Set the pixel at (_x, y_) to the color _c_.
#### `static pget(x: Number, y: Number): Color `
Get the color of the pixel at (_x, y_).

#### `static rect(x: Number, y: Number, w: Number, h: Number, c: Color) `
Draw a rectangle with the top-left corner at (_x, y_), with a width of _w_ and _h_ in color _c_.

#### `static rectfill(x: Number, y: Number, w: Number, h: Number, c: Color) `
Draw a filled rectangle with the top-left corner at (_x, y_), with a width of _w_ and _h_ in color _c_.

#### `static resize(width: Number, height: Number)`
#### `static resize(width: Number, height: Number, c: Color)`
Resize the canvas to the given `width` and `height`, and reset the color of the canvas to `c`.
If `c` isn't provided, we default to black.
Resizing the canvas resets the "clipping region" to encompass the whole canvas, as if `Canvas.clip()` was called.

#### `static triangle(x0: Number, y0: Number, x1: Number, y1: Number, x2: Number, y2: Number, c: Color) `
Draw a triangle with vertices at (_x0, y0_), (_x1, y1_), (_x2, y2_) in the color _c_.

#### `static trianglefill(x0: Number, y0: Number, x1: Number, y1: Number, x2: Number, y2: Number, c: Color) `
Draw a filled triangle with vertices at (_x0, y0_), (_x1, y1_), (_x2, y2_) in the color _c_.

## Color

An instance of the `Color` class represents a single color which can be used for drawing to the `Canvas`.
DOME comes built-in with the PICO-8 palette, but you can also define and use your own colors in your games.

### Constructors

#### `construct hex(hexcode: String)`
Create a new color with the given hexcode as a string of three to eight alphanumeric values. Hex values can be upper or lowercase, with or without a `#`. If three or four digits are provided, the number is interpreted as if each digit was written twice (similar to CSS): for example, `#123` is the same as `#112233`. If four or eight digits found, the last digit(s) form the value of the alpha channel. Otherwise, it is defaulted to 255 (fully opaque).
#### `construct hsv(h: Number, s: Number, v: Number)`
Create a new color using the given HSV number and an alpha value of `255`. 
The `s` and `v` parameters must be between `0.0` and `1.0`. 
#### `construct hsv(h: Number, s: Number, v: Number, a: Number)`
Create a new color using the given HSV number and an alpha value of `a`, between `0 - 255`. 
The `s` and `v` parameters must be between `0.0` and `1.0`. 

#### `construct rgb(r: Number, g: Number, b: Number)`
Create a new color with the given RGB values between `0 - 255`, and an alpha value of `255`.

#### `construct rgb(r: Number, g: Number, b: Number, a: Number)`
Create a new color with the given RGBA values between `0 - 255`.

#### `construct new(r: Number, g: Number, b: Number)`
#### `construct new(r: Number, g: Number, b: Number, a: Number)`
Deprecated, aliases for `rgb` constructor.

### Instance Fields

#### `r: Number`
A value between `0 - 255` to represent the red color channel.

#### `g: Number`
A value between `0 - 255` to represent the green color channel.

#### `b: Number`
A value between `0 - 255` to represent the blue color channel.

#### `a: Number`
A value between `0 - 255` to represent the alpha transparency channel.

### Default Palette
The values for the colors in this palette can be found [here](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/pico-8-color-palette/).

 * `static black: Color`
 * `static darkblue : Color`
 * `static darkpurple: Color`
 * `static darkgreen: Color`
 * `static brown: Color`
 * `static darkgray: Color`
 * `static lightgray: Color`
 * `static white: Color`
 * `static red: Color`
 * `static orange: Color`
 * `static yellow: Color`
 * `static green: Color`
 * `static blue: Color`
 * `static indigo: Color`
 * `static pink: Color`
 * `static peach: Color`

In addition to these two values:
 * `static none: Color` - Representing clear transparency.
 * `static purple: Color` - `#8d3cff`, the DOME logo color.

## Drawable
Represents an object which can be drawn to the screen. Objects which conform to this interface can be passed to `Canvas.draw(drawable, x, y)`.
### Instance Methods
#### `draw(x: Number, y: Number): Void`
Draw the image at the given `(x, y)` position on the screen.

## Font

DOME includes a built-in fixed 8x8 pixel font, but you can also load and use fonts from TTF files stored on the file system.

### Static Methods
#### `static load(name: String, path: String, size: Number): Font`
Load the font file at `path`, rasterize it to the pixel height of `size`, and map this to the `name` for later reference. You will need to call this once for each font size, and `name` must be unique, or you will overwrite the old font.

#### `static [fontName]: Font`
You can retrieve a specific font using the index operator, for example `Font["NewFont"]`.

### Instance Methods
#### `getArea(text: String): Vector`
Calculate the maximum size that this font will take to print `text` to the display. Returns as a [`Vector`](./math#vector) of `(width, height)`.

#### `print(text: String, x: Number, y: Number, color: Color): Void`
Print the `text` on the canvas at `(x, y)`, in the given `color`.

### Instance Field
#### `antialias: Boolean`
TTF fonts can be scaled to any size, but to look good at certain sizes, you can set antialias to `true` so that some pixels are made partially transparent, to appear smoother. This is `false` by default.

## ImageData
### _extends Drawable_

This class represents the data from an image, such as a sprite or tilemap. 
DOME supports the following formats:
 * JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib)
 * PNG 1/2/4/8/16-bit-per-channel
 * BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE

### Static Methods

#### `static [name]: ImageData`
Fetch a cached image, if it's available. Returns `null` otherwise.

#### `static create(name: String, width: Number, height: Number): ImageData`
Creates a blank image of the size `width x height` and caches it as `name` for future use.

#### `static load(path: String): ImageData`
Load an image at the given `path` and cache it for use.
#### `static loadFromFile(path: String): ImageData`
Load an image at the given `path` and cache it for use. `loadFromFile` is deprecated, use `load` instead.

### Instance Fields
#### `height: Number`
#### `width: Number`

### Instance Methods
#### `draw(x: Number, y: Number): Void`
Draw the image at the given `(x, y)` position on the screen.

#### `drawArea(srcX: Number, srcY: Number, srcW: Number, srcH: Number, destX: Number, destY: Number): Void`
Draw a subsection of the image, defined by the rectangle `(srcX, srcY)` to `(srcX + srcW, srcY + srcH)`. The resulting section is placed at `(destX, destY)`.

#### `pset(x: Number, y: Number, color: Color): Void`
Set a pixel at `(x, y)` in the ImageData to color `c`.

#### `pget(x: Number, y: Number): Color`
Fetch the current pixel at `(x, y)` in the ImageData.

#### `saveToFile(path: String): Void`
Saves the current image data at the given `path`.

#### `transform(parameterMap): Drawable`
This returns a `Drawable` which will perform the specified transforms, allowing for more fine-grained control over how images are drawn. You can store the returned drawable and reuse it across frames, while the image is loaded.

Options available are:

 * `srcX`, `srcY` - These specify the top-left corner of the source image region you wish to draw.
 * `srcW`, `srcH` - This is the width and height of the source image region you want to draw.
 * `scaleX`, `scaleY` - You can scale your image in the x and y axis, independent of each other. If either of these are negative, they result in a "flip" operation.
 * `angle` - Rotates the image. This is in degrees, and rounded to the nearest 90 degrees.
 * `opacity` - A number between 0.0 and 1.0, this sets the global opacity of this image. Any alpha values in the image will be multiplied by this value,
 * `tint` - A color value which is to be applied on top of the image. Use the tint color's alpha to control how strong the tint is.
 * `mode`, `foreground` and `background` - By default, mode is `"RGBA"`, so your images will draw in their true colors. If you set it to `"MONO"`, any pixels which are black or have transparency will be drawn in the `background` color and all other pixels of the image will be drawn in the `foreground` color. Both colors must be `Color` objects, and default to `Color.black` and `Color.white`, respectively.

Transforms are applied as follows: Crop to the region, then rotate, then scale/flip.

Here is an example:
```wren
spriteSheet.transform({
  "srcX": 8, "srcY": 8,
  "srcW": 8, "srcH": 8,
  "scaleX": 2,
  "scaleY": -2,
  "angle": 90
}).draw(x, y)
```
The code snippet above:
 * crops an 8x8 tile from a spritesheet, starting from (8, 8) in it's image data
 * It then rotates it 90 degrees clockwise
 * Finally, it scales the tile up by 2 in both the X and Y direction, but it flips the tile vertically.

## SpriteSheet

This class can load in an image and divide it into a fixed-size grid of smaller squares, as a convenience.
It's useful for loading multiple sprites from a single file. This can also be used as the foundation of an 
animation system, when multiple frames are stored on the same image.

Sprites can be chosen via `index`. Sprites are numbered from 0, left-to-right across the spritesheet,
and then in rows from top-to-bottom. 

### Constructor

#### `load(path: String, tileSize: Number): SpriteSheet`
#### `load(path: String, tileSize: Number, scale: Number): SpriteSheet`

This loads a file from disk at `path` and treats it as a grid of images of `tileSize` wide and tall.
The dimensions of the spritesheet at `path` need to be an exact multiple of `tileSize`.

#### `loadFromImage(image: ImageData, tileSize: Number): SpriteSheet`
#### `loadFromImage(image: ImageData, tileSize: Number, scale: Number): SpriteSheet`

This takes an already loaded `image` and treats it as a grid of sprites of `tileSize` wide and tall.
The dimensions of the spritesheet at `path` need to be an exact multiple of `tileSize`.

### Instance Fields

#### `getTile(index: Number): DrawCommand`
Get a `DrawCommand` for rendering the tile `index`.

#### `draw(index: Number, x: Number, y: Number)`
Draw tile `index` on the spritesheet at location `(x, y)` on screen.

#### `draw(index: Number, x: Number, y: Number, parameterMap)`
Draw tile `index` on the spritesheet at location `(x, y)` on screen. This will also apply the given transform `parameterMap` to the tile being drawn.
You can reference the `ImageData.transform` documentation for a list of available parameters.

#### `drawFrom(tileX: Number, tileY: Number, x: Number, y: Number)`
Draw tile `(tileX, tileY)` on the spritesheet at location `(x, y)` on screen.

#### `drawFrom(tileX: Number, tileY: Number, x: Number, y: Number, parameterMap)`
Draw tile `(tileX, tileY)` on the spritesheet at location `(x, y)` on screen. This will also apply the given transform `parameterMap` to the tile being drawn.
You can reference the `ImageData.transform` documentation for a list of available parameters.

### Instance Methods

#### `fg: Color`
The `SpriteSheet` will render the sprite using this color if the pixel isn't transparent.
#### `bg: Color`
The `SpriteSheet` will render the sprite using this color if the pixel is transparent.
